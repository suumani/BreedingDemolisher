# Breeding Demolisher

Breeding Demolisher introduces a world where demolishers can reproduce.
Over time (and through combat), demolishers lay eggs, hatch, and increase in number.
If left unchecked, they can become an exponentially growing threat.

## Concept
This mod reimagines demolishers not only as enemies to defeat,
but as a growing ecosystem that must be managed and contained.

It is designed for players who enjoy high-risk, high-density combat environments.

## What this mod adds
### Natural reproduction
- Periodic reproduction that creates eggs
- Eggs hatch after some time
- Population growth is controlled by a global cap and current population
- Eggs may drop from defeated demolishers
- Hatch quality and egg dispersion scale with evolution

### Player interaction / Pets
- Eggs can sometimes be obtained by defeating wild demolishers
- Eggs can be hatched into “pet” demolishers
- Pets can be hostile / neutral / friendly
- Mature pets reproduce and lay eggs
- Offspring may inherit traits/abilities from parents
- Eggs produced via breeding tend to be higher quality than drop eggs

## Supported environment
