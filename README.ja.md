# Breeding Demolisher

Breeding Demolisher is a mod that adds a world where demolishers can reproduce.  
Over time (and through combat), eggs are produced, hatch, and increase the overall population.  
If left unchecked, the threat can grow exponentially.

## Concept
This mod reinterprets demolishers not only as enemies to be defeated,  
but as a **growing ecosystem** that must be managed and contained.

It is designed for players who enjoy high-risk, high-density combat environments.

## Added Gameplay

### Natural Breeding
- Periodic egg laying
- Eggs hatch over time
- Reproduction is controlled based on the current population and a global cap
- Eggs may drop when demolishers are defeated
- Hatch quality and spread scale with the evolution factor
- The total number of demolishers is capped at **200** (prioritizing performance stability)

### Player Interaction / Pets
- Eggs may be obtained by defeating wild demolishers
- Eggs can be hatched into **pet demolishers**
- Pets can be hostile, neutral, or friendly
- Pets grow over time and may reproduce when mature
- Offspring may inherit traits and abilities from their parents
- Eggs produced through breeding tend to be higher quality than dropped eggs
- New-species demolishers are an intermediate evolutionary stage and eventually lead to friendly demolishers

### Breeding and Genetics
- Pet demolishers reproduce as they grow
- Eggs produced through breeding **retain genetic information**
- Genetic data is preserved through transport, storage, and hatching
- Two-parent breeding tends to produce more favorable offspring

## Planetary Restrictions
- Demolishers are native to **Vulcanus**
- Egg processing and evolution (size evolution, new-species evolution, freezing/unfreezing)
  can only be performed on Vulcanus
- Hatched demolishers can be transported to and deployed on other planets

## Supported Environment
- Factorio 2.0 (Space Age required)
